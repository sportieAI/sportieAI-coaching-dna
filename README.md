## 🌳 Coaching Tree Matrix

Each coach is defined by:
- First NFL or college seat
- Coaching lineage (e.g., Shanahan → McDaniel)
- Scheme identity (e.g., Outside Zone / Motion-Heavy)
- Signal tags (e.g., `MotionMaster`, `QBAmplifier`)
- Legacy echo commentary

---

## 🔩 Signal Tags

Signal tags inject behavior into simulations:
- `EraserLogic`: Belichick-style opponent neutralization
- `SpeedOverSize`: Reid-style vertical aggression
- `AggressionCollapse`: LaFleur-style playoff conservatism
- `QBAmplifier`: Coaches who elevate QB performance
- `CultureMismatch`: Scheme vs team identity conflict

---

## 🧬 Capsule Commentary

Capsules narrate coaching impact:
> *“Carroll’s override of Lynch triggered collapse. Coaching misalignment detected. Legacy echo confirmed.”*

> *“Harbaugh’s defensive loyalty suppressed Jackson’s improvisational edge. Culture mismatch detected.”*

---

## 🪞 Team History Signals

Franchise-level traits:
- `LegacyBurden`: Historical playoff collapse
- `BigBrotherCeiling`: Psychological block vs divisional rival
- `BallDestinyTrigger`: Weakness exposed in high-leverage moments

---
